# Week 1 Project Scope: 

## Project Name
MyHome Electricity Calculator

## Domain
Smart Home and Energy Efficiency

## Problem Statement
Many households do not know which rooms and appliances consume the most electricity or how their daily habits affect their electricity bills. Existing calculators can estimate energy usage, but users may need more personalised guidance to understand their results and identify possible improvements. MyHome Energy Calculator combines electricity calculations, bill calculators,  interactive dashboards, AI recommendations, a chatbot, and a what-if simulator to help users make better energy-saving decisions.

## Evidence of the Problem
 - **Evidence 1:** Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) provides household energy calculation tools and energy-saving guidance. This provides a starting point for understanding existing solutions and identifying opportunities for improvement.

- **Evidence 2:** Household electricity costs depend on factors such as appliance power ratings, usage hours, and applicable electricity tariffs. The Energy Commission also explains the components of the electricity pricing framework.

## Engineering Gap / Limitation
Existing tools provide electricity calculations and energy-saving information. The proposed engineering gap is to combine household-level comparisons, personalised AI explanations, a chatbot connected to household data, and a what-if simulator in one interactive system.
The system will use a calculation engine for numerical results and an AI model to explain those results and generate relevant recommendations. Potential savings will be calculated using the system's formulas rather than generated as unsupported figures by the AI.

## Initial Project Objectives (2–3)

- O1: To develop an interactive household energy calculator that estimates electricity consumption and costs based on rooms, appliances, and usage patterns.
- O2: To develop a dashboard that compares electricity consumption across floors, rooms, and appliances.
- O3: To implement AI-powered recommendations, a chatbot, and a what-if simulator to help users understand their energy usage and explore potential savings.

## Target Users
- Malaysian households that want to understand their electricity consumption.
- Homeowners and tenants who want to identify appliances that use more electricity.
- Users who want to explore ways to reduce electricity usage and estimated bills.

## Similar to EduAdvisor
The similarity is limited to providing a digital platform that helps users understand information and make better decisions. MyHome Energy Calculator focuses specifically on household electricity consumption and energy efficiency.

## Different from EduAdvisor
EduAdvisor focuses on education-related information and guidance, while MyHome Energy Calculator focuses on household energy usage.


## Responsible AI Risks (at least 2)

**Risk 1:** Inaccurate AI Recommendations
- The AI may provide advice that does not match the user's actual household situation or may misunderstand the calculated results.
  
- **Mitigation:** Provide the AI with relevant calculated household data, use clear prompts, and check recommendations against the system's calculations. Users should be able to see the figures supporting each recommendation.

**Risk 2:** Incorrect Electricity Cost Estimates
- The system may produce estimates that differ from actual bills because of inaccurate user inputs, tariff changes, monthly adjustments, taxes, or other applicable charges.

- **Mitigation:** Document the tariff assumptions, check official pricing information, and clearly label the output as an estimate rather than an exact bill.

**Risk 3:** Household Data Privacy
- Household information may reveal details about users' homes and daily routines.

- **Mitigation:** Collect only the information needed for the system, avoid requesting unnecessary personal details, protect stored data, and avoid sending identifiable information to an AI service.
